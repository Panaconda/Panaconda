## Welcome! 
This repository serves as an overview of the projects I’ve worked on throughout my journey in data science  

##  About me
I am a **Master’s student in Statistics and Data Science at LMU Munich**, planning to complete my master’s thesis in 2026.  
During my **Bachelor’s in Economics at the University of Mannheim**, I discovered a strong interest in econometrics and data analysis, which led me to specialize in quantitative methods.  
Then I gained practical experience through internships in **Advanced Analytics** at an IT consulting firm and in **Business Intelligence**, where I worked on applying data-driven solutions in real-world business contexts.  
My academic background provides me with a broad skill set, from traditional likelihood-based modeling to machine learning and deep learning architectures.  
I’m looking forward to continuing to expand my knowledge and applying it to impactful, data-centric projects.
